# LLM from Scratch
 
 Personal implementation (from scratch) following **Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)** by Sebastian Raschka.
 
 ## Project structure (planned)
 
 - `src/`: implementation
 - `scripts/`: training/evaluation/generation scripts
 - `notebooks/`: experiments
 - `configs/`: hyperparameter/config files
 - `data/`: datasets (typically gitignored)
 
 ## Setup
 
 1. Create a virtual environment.
 2. Install dependencies (to be defined).
 
 ## Usage
 
 Commands and scripts will be added as the implementation grows.
